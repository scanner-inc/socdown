## Investigation Process

### Tool Usage Documentation

> **🔍 Step 1: `mcp__scanner__execute_query` - Historical Alert Lookup**
> 
> **Parameters**:
> - Query: `@index="_detections" id:"cf1be781-0099-4809-b386-e7208d496cb6"`
> - Time Range: 1970-01-01 to 2025-12-31 (wide range for alert lookup)
> 
> **Findings**:
> - Historical alert found from August 2025
> - Same detection rule ID as recent alert (0851a7b9-df94-4ae6-90b4-da5f9b34ec77)
> - Identical rule name: "test webhook"
> - Same query: `hi | count | where @q.count > 0`
> - Matched 3,583 events containing "hi" in August timeframe
> 
> **Analysis**: This is the same test webhook rule that triggered recently - indicates a recurring pattern of false positives from the same detection rule

> **🚨 Step 2: `mcp__scanner__execute_query` - Rule History Analysis** 
> 
> **Parameters**:
> - Query: `@index="_detections" detection_rule_id:"0851a7b9-df94-4ae6-90b4-da5f9b34ec77" | groupbycount(id)`
> - Time Range: 1970-01-01 to 2025-12-31 (all time)
> 
> **Findings**:
> - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: This test rule has generated 1,000+ alerts over time
> - Shows systematic pattern of recurring false positives
> - Some alert IDs appear multiple times (up to 4 occurrences)
> - Rule has been persistently active in production environment
> 
> **Analysis**: This reveals a major systemic issue - the test rule has been generating massive numbers of false positive alerts, creating significant alert fatigue and potentially masking real threats

> **📊 Step 3: `mcp__scanner__execute_query` - Historical Event Validation**
> 
> **Parameters**:
> - Query: `hi | count`
> - Time Range: 2025-08-08 to 2025-08-09 (historical alert period)
> 
> **Findings**:
> - Confirmed 3,585 total "hi" matches in August timeframe
> - Very close to alert reported count (3,583 vs 3,585)
> - Validates that alert accurately captured underlying event count
> 
> **Analysis**: The historical alert was accurate in its event counting - the issue is not with detection accuracy but with the appropriateness of having this test rule active in production

## Technical Details

### Alert Metadata
- **Alert ID**: cf1be781-0099-4809-b386-e7208d496cb6
- **Detection Rule ID**: 0851a7b9-df94-4ae6-90b4-da5f9b34ec77 (Same as recent alert)
- **Rule Name**: test webhook
- **Description**: hi
- **Query**: `hi | count | where @q.count > 0`
- **Severity**: Medium (ID: 3)
- **Results**: 3,583 matching events
- **Time Range**: 2025-08-08T00:00:00Z to 2025-08-09T00:00:00Z
- **Alert Generated**: 2025-08-09T00:00:47Z

### Pattern Analysis
This alert represents a historical instance of the same test webhook rule that triggered recently:

**Comparison with Recent Alert (2c693864-2911-49c3-87d9-8de3c45e916e)**:
- Same detection rule ID: 0851a7b9-df94-4ae6-90b4-da5f9b34ec77
- Same rule name: "test webhook"
- Same query pattern: `hi | count | where @q.count > 0`
- Similar event counts: 3,583 (Aug) vs 4,472 (Sept)
- Indicates recurring pattern of this test rule triggering on legitimate operational logs

### Query Analysis
The detection query remains identical to the recent investigation:
- Extremely broad search for "hi" token in any log field
- Triggers on any occurrence (count > 0)
- Consistently matches thousands of legitimate Scanner operational events

## Threat Assessment

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
- **Tactic**: None identified - test detection rule
- **Technique**: Not applicable

### Threat Actor Profile
- **Sophistication**: Not applicable - test rule recurring pattern
- **Goals**: Webhook testing functionality
- **Methods**: Simple text matching

### Impact Analysis
- **Data Compromised**: None - historical false positive from persistent test rule
- **Systems Affected**: None - systematic false positive generation
- **Business Impact**: **SIGNIFICANT** - 1,000+ false positive alerts causing alert fatigue and masking real threats

## Recommendations

### Immediate (0-4 hours)
- [ ] Disable the recurring test webhook rule (ID: 0851a7b9-df94-4ae6-90b4-da5f9b34ec77)
- [ ] Review all historical alerts from this same rule ID
- [ ] Document pattern of false positives from this test rule

### Short-term (1-7 days)  
- [ ] Implement test rule expiration or automatic cleanup
- [ ] Create separate testing environment for webhook validation
- [ ] Review other test rules for similar recurring false positive patterns

### Long-term (1-4 weeks)
- [ ] Establish test detection rule governance
- [ ] Implement automated cleanup of test rules
- [ ] Create monitoring for recurring false positive patterns
- [ ] Develop webhook testing framework that doesn't trigger production alerts

## Lessons Learned

### Investigation Gaps Identified
- **CRITICAL**: Test rule has generated 1,000+ false positive alerts over extended period
- No monitoring or alerting on excessive false positive patterns
- No automatic cleanup or expiration for test detection rules
- Systematic failure in test rule lifecycle management

### Process Improvements  
- Implement test rule lifecycle management with automatic expiration
- Create separate environments for webhook and detection rule testing
- Monitor for recurring alert patterns that indicate systemic issues
- Regular audit of test vs production detection rules

### Detection Enhancements Needed
- Test detection rules should have built-in expiration dates
- Automated identification of recurring false positive patterns
- Better isolation of test functionality from production alerting
- Webhook testing should use dedicated test identifiers, not generic tokens
